# coding-challenges

As a computer science student, I am not unfamiliar with common data structures
and designing techniques, but I am often astonished by the way they are used in
coding challenges. When I first encountered the Edit Distance problem, I knew I
should Dynamic Program it, but it never occurred to me that the subproblems are
not steps of editing, but distances between (prefix) substrings!

After going over the basics, I decided to open-source any of my coding challenge
footprints here, and add some personal analysis to:

- "brain teaser" solutions,
- algorithms known by less but are highly effective for certain problems (such
  as the Boyer-Moore Voting), and
- hard problems that I don't have a clue at first glance.

Problems covered here should be mostly the level of LeetCode hards, and some of
them may be mediums that hit my weak points.

Happy coding! And, study for curiosity, not for examinations.
